# Project Title

Enigma on steroids

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

```
Simple programme for encrypts and decrypts files.
Usage:      -c [file of files, you can use reg.]  
                Encryption the file (default key will be used the last created in the keys directory,
                the drums will be loaded with all the last ones created in the rotors directory)  
            -d [file of files, you can use reg.]
                Decryption the file (default are the same as with encryption)
            -c [file] -k [file or key name in dictionary keys]  
                Encryption with the indicated key
            -d [file] -k [file or key name in dictionary keys]  
                Decryption with the indicated key
            -c [file] -k [file] -r [first rotor file, or name in dictionary rotors]
                Encryption with the indicated key and indicated rotors and their number
            -d [file] -k [file] -r [first rotor file, or name in dictionary rotors]
                Decryption with the indicated key and indicated rotors and their number
            
            -K [name], [size]       Create key, size in bits
            -R [name], [number]     Create rotors, name only common part, number of created rotors
            
            -v --verbose            Show all progress
            -s --silent            If you wont to encrypt text directly from keybord or if you decript txt file, 
                                            use this option if you wont only read mesages without save files
            
            -h --help               Display this help and exit
            -V --version            Output version information and exit
            # todo -t --tests              Run tests encrypt and decrypt
            # todo -rsa             Lock and anlock with rsa keys
            # todo -f               Force if you have enough time then use this option for aplay larger keys and more rotors
            
Examples:   simnigma.py -K your_key_name 2048 
                First you need to create a random key, 2048 it is size in bit 
            simnigma.py -R your_rotors_name 20 
                Then you have to create a random 8-bit rotors, 8bit is the default setting for files, 
                20 is the number of rotors 
            simnigma.py -c some_file.txt [-k your_key_name] [-r your_rotors_name] 
                Now you can encrypt any file or files if you use reg. [for example *], encrypted files
                will be updated .enc. You can also use a different key or rotors if you insert the -k or -r option.
                By default, the most recently created keys and rotors are loaded from the keys and rotors 
                catalogs from the simnigma.py directory.
            simnigma.py -d some_file.txt.enc [-k your_key_name] [-r your_rotors_name] 
                And last you can decrypt file or files, remember that you must use the same rotors and keys as
                 you use to encrypt, what is logically

                               FORMAT is interpreted like in 'date'; if FORMAT
                               is FORMAT1<newline>FORMAT2, then FORMAT1 applies
                               to non-recent files and FORMAT2 to recent files;
                               if STYLE is prefixed with 'posix-', STYLE

  -U                         do not sort; list entries in directory order
  -v                         natural sort of (version) numbers within text

      --help     display this help and exit
      --version  output version information and exit

The SIZE argument is an integer and optional unit (example: 10K is 10*1024).
Units are K,M,G,T,P,E,Z,Y (powers of 1024) or KB,MB,... (powers of 1000).

Using color to distinguish file types is disabled both by default and
with --color=never.  With --color=auto, ls emits color codes only when
standard output is connected to a terminal.  The LS_COLORS environment
variable can change the settings.  Use the dircolors command to set it.

Exit status:
 0  if OK,
 1  if minor problems (e.g., cannot access subdirectory),
 2  if serious trouble (e.g., cannot access command-line argument).
