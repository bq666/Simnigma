Simple programme for encrypts and decrypts files.
Usage:      enigma5 -c [file of files, you can use reg.]  
                Encryption the file (default key will be used the last created in the keys directory,
                the drums will be loaded with all the last ones created in the rotors directory)  
            enigma5 -d [file of files, you can use reg.]
                Decryption the file (default are the same as with encryption)
            enigma5 -c [file] -k [file or key name in dictionary keys]  
                Encryption with the indicated key
            enigma5 -d [file] -k [file or key name in dictionary keys]  
                Decryption with the indicated key
            enigma5 -c [file] -k [file] -r [first rotor file, or name in dictionary rotors]
                Encryption with the indicated key and indicated rotors and their number
            enigma5 -d [file] -k [file] -r [first rotor file, or name in dictionary rotors]
                Decryption with the indicated key and indicated rotors and their number
            
            enigma5 -R [name], [number]     Create rotors, name only common part, number of created rotors
            enigma5 -K [name], [size]       Create key, size in bits
            
            enigma5 -v --verbose            Show all progress
            # todo enigma5 -t --tests              Run tests encrypt and decrypt
            enigma5 -h --help               Display this help and exit
            enigma5 -V --version            Output version information and exit
   
Examples:   enigma5.py -K your_key_name 2048 -v
                First you need to create a random key, 2048 it is size in bit 
            enigma5.py -R your_rotors_name 20 -v
                Then you have to create a random 8-bit rotors, 8bit is the default setting for files, 
                20 is the number of rotors 
            enigma5.py -c some_file.txt [-k your_key_name] [-r your_rotors_name] -v
                Now you can encrypt any file or files if you use reg. [for example *], encrypted files
                will be updated .enc. You can also use a different key or rotors if you insert the -k or -r option.
                By default, the most recently created keys and rotors are loaded from the keys and rotors 
                catalogs from the enigma5.py directory.
            enigma5.py -d some_file.txt.enc [-k your_key_name] [-r your_rotors_name] -v
                And last you can decrypt file or files, remember that you must use the same rotors and keys as
                 you use to encrypt, what is logically
